# Text Summarization Project

# Project Overview

The Text Summarization project aims to develop an automated system that can generate concise and coherent summaries from large bodies of text. The primary goal is to enable users to quickly understand the main points of lengthy documents without having to read through the entire content. This project leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate and meaningful summaries.

# Key Features

1. Data Ingestion:
   - Module: `textSummarizer.pipeline.stage_01_data_ingestion`
   - Description: This module handles the extraction and loading of text data from various sources such as web pages, documents, and databases. It ensures that the input data is in a suitable format for processing.

2. Data Validation:
   - Module: `textSummarizer.pipeline.stage_02_data_validation`
   - Description: This module performs validation checks on the ingested data to ensure its quality and consistency. It removes any corrupt or irrelevant data and standardizes the text format for further processing.

3. Text Preprocessing:
   - Description: This component involves cleaning the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and other non-essential elements. It also includes tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming to prepare the text for summarization.

4. Summarization Algorithms:
   - Description: The core of the project, this component implements various summarization algorithms. Both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques are utilized to generate summaries. The project explores methods like TextRank, BERT-based summarization, and transformer models.

5. Evaluation and Metrics:
   - Description: This module evaluates the performance of the summarization algorithms using metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). It ensures that the summaries are both accurate and coherent.

6. User Interface:
   - Description: The project includes a user-friendly interface where users can input text and receive summaries. The interface allows for customization of summary length and style.
